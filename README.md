# DSA-Algorithm-Practice

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions implemented in TypeScript. This is basically my notes for practicing DSA & Algorithm.

This repository aims to help you practice and improve your problem-solving skills in DSA. Each problem is accompanied by a solution written in TypeScript, a popular statically-typed programming language. TypeScript helps make code easier to read, write, and maintain, and provides features like interfaces and type checking that can help prevent bugs.

In addition to the problem solutions, I have also included a test file. You can use this file to test your own implementations of the problems. To do so, simply delete the provided solutions and write your own, then run the test file to see if your implementation passes the test cases. This can help you focus on the implementation details of the problem without having to worry about writing the test cases yourself. The test link is in `__tests__` folder. 

I hope that this repository helps you in your DSA practice and provides a useful resource for you to refer to when working on similar problems in the future. Happy coding!

## How to Use this repo
- Clone this repository
- `npm install`. This will install all the dependency.
- `npm run test. This runs the test.
- find the problem that you'd like to work with then remove the solution. You can start write your own implementation. And run `npm run test` to check whether the solution passes the test or not.
